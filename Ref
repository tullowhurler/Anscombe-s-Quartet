“numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough.”

He then presents a table of numbers. 

It contains four distinct datasets (hence the name Anscombe’s Quartet), each with statistical properties that are essentially identical: 
the mean of the x values is 9.0, mean of y values is 7.5, they all have nearly identical variances, correlations, 
and regression lines (to at least two decimal places).

Data visualization is crucial in developing a sensible statistical model. 
"A computer should make both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of output should be studied; each will contribute to understanding."

first- and second-order summary statistics don't say everything you might want to know about your data, so remember to plot it.

The bottom two panels show that these summary statistics are sensitive to outliers. 
A generalization of the bottom right panel arises often in real life: you might have, say, two noisy clouds corresponding to two groups. 
You observe a correlation induced by the grouping, but after controlling for the group, the correlation disappears.

The top right panel shows that, even though we are taught that correlation measures a linear association between two variables, we can have high correlations (0.816 in this case) even when the relationship is nonlinear.
